\section{Introduction}
\hspace{\parindent}In 1967, Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker developed a theorem that placed constraints on the types of hidden-variable theories that may be used to explain quantum mechanical phenomenon. Specifically, they demonstrated the existence of a set $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that there is no value function $f: \mathcal{S} \to \{0, 1\}$ satisfying
\[f(\vec{u}) + f(\vec{v}) + f(\vec{w}) = 1\]
for all triples $(\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w})$ of mutually orthogonal vectors in $\mathcal{S}$. To do so, Kochen and Specker constructed a set of 117 vectors that they had to manually verify did not meet the above condition given any value function. As mathematicians have started to turn to computers to solve mathematical problems such as the four color theorem, we may ask whether the same could be done for certain Kochen-Specker systems. That is, can a computer tell us whether a Kochen-Specker systems verifies the theorem above?

\section{Constructing a Kochen-Specker System}
\hspace{\parindent}Before developing a coloring algorithm, we must specify the types of mathematical objects we want to undergo this coloring process. While Kochen and Specker considered vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, we will be restricting ourselves to 3-dimensional integer vectors so that we may be able to better explore the number theoretic implications of the Kochen-Specker Theorem. We define the sets of vectors we want to color as follows:
\[\mathcal{S}(N) = \{\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^{3}: ||\mathbf{v}||^{2} \text{ divides a power of } N\}.\]
The reasoning for this is that we can equate a Kochen-Specker coloring of this set with a Kochen-Specker coloring of rank-1 projection matrices whose entries lie in the same mathematical space as the orthogonal projection matrix of vectors in $\mathcal{S}(N)$. However, $\mathcal{S}(N)$ is an infinite set. Since computers can only store a finite amount of data, we must consider a subset of the original set. Thus, we will pivot towards considering the smaller set
\[s(N) = \{\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^{3}: ||\mathbf{v}||^{2} \text{ divides } N\} \subset \mathcal{S}(N).\]
However, if we ever need more vectors to generate new coloring information for the set $\mathcal{S}(N)$, we can simply select a power of $N$ as input for the set $s(N)$, as
\[s(N^{k}) \subset \mathcal{S}(N)\]
for all positive integers $k$.

To actually generate the set $s(N)$ in our Python program, we leverage a package that allows us to solve Diophantine equations of the form $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = N$. By determining a solution to this equation, we get the entries of a vector in $s(N)$. Thus, all possible solutions to a fixed Diophantine equation yields all possible integers vectors in the set $s(N)$. In our GitHub repository, the \texttt{Sum\_of\_Squares\_and\_Divisibility.py} file contains the function \texttt{sum\_of\_squares\_solutions} which extracts and permutes all solutions to the Diophantine equation mentioned above (the latter ensures that we include negative solutions/vector entries). It returns a tuple with these solutions which we can interpret as the vector representations we are interested in coloring.

Now, to minimize the search our algorithm must perform, we consider primitive, well-signed vectors. Recall that an integer vector is \textit{primitive} if its entries have a greatest common divisor equal to 1. An integer vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^{3} \setminus 0$ is \textit{well-signed} if either:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathbf{v}$ has only one nonzero entry which is positive,
	\item $\mathbf{v}$ has two nonzero entries and its first nonzero entry is positive, or
	\item $\mathbf{v}$ has three nonzero entries, at least two of which are positive. 
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{Primitive\_Well\_Signed\_Vectors.py} file contains the functions \texttt{primitive} and \texttt{well\_signed}, which determine whether a tuple obtained from calling the \texttt{sum\_of\_squares\_solutions} function is primitive and well-signed. These helper functions are used in the \texttt{primitive\_well\_signed\_solutions} function, which takes as a parameter the positive integer $N$ corresponding to the set of vectors $s(N)$ and returns the set of vectors we want to color according to the Kochen-Specker Theorem.

\section{The Coloring Algorithm}

\section{Spectral Graph Theory}
\hspace{\parindent}Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ is the set of vertices representing  vectors in a Kochen-Specker system and $E$ is a set of edges between two vertices. Suppose $v_{1}, v_{2} \in V$. There exists an edge $\{v_{1}, v_{2}\} \in E$ if the integer vectors corresponding to $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are orthogonal.\\

[INSERT EXAMPLE FROM NOTES]\\

Now, let $A$ be the adjacency matrix corresponding to the graph $G$ and $\mathbf{c}$ be a coloring vector whose entries are defined as follows:
\[c_{i} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if the vector } v_{i} \text{ is assigned the value 1} \,, \\
						0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]
We claim that the resulting vector $\mathbf{d} = A \mathbf{c}$ has entries where the $i$th entry corresponds to the number of 1 vectors adjacent to the $v_{i}$ vector.
